### Continued development

I now somewhat understand creating responsive components so I would like to further my skills and understanding towards making components and responsive websites by practicing and creating more projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - I used the MDN documentation to refresh my memory of how some elements were used and helped me understand some facts I didn't know before. 

- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I used the W3Schools website to refresh my memory and guided me on how to style and select certain elements.

- [Resource 3](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me for generate a box-shadow instead of having to edit and change it all the time. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
