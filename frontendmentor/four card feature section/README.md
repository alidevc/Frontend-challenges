### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - I used the MDN documentation to refresh my memory of how some elements were used, like the grid layout and helped me understand some facts I didn't know before. 

- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I used the W3Schools website to refresh my memory and guided me on  how to style and select certain elements.
