### Continued development

Moving forward I plan to further my skills and understanding in javascript so that I may be able to utilize it with confidence to create beautiful, responsive, and useful websites by practicing and creating more projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - I used the MDN documentation to refresh my memory of how some elements were used, like the grid layout and helped me understand some facts I didn't know before. 

- [Resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/working-with-javascript-media-queries/) - This helped me understand how to work with javascript media queries. It gave me an overview on how I can use it and some other ways I found to be interesting.
