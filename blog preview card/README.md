### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me for generate a box-shadow instead of having to edit and change it all the time.I really liked this website and will use it going forward.

- [Resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-media-queries-breakpoints-media-types-standard-resolutions-and-more/) - This article helped me understand and guided me through what media queries are and how I can use/apply it. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning or struggling in this concept.
